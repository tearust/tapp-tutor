# What is TEA Party

TEA Party is a demo application running on TEA Project. 

We build TEA Party in order to demostrate 

- What a typical TApp looks like

- The building blocks of a typical TApp

- How to use Tea Party as a boilderplate to build your own TApps

  

TEA Party is a useful social media application. User can post message to public board, send private message with notification.

  

As all other TApps, TEA party shows the typical specities beyond other cloud based internet application (web2.0) applications. There is a centralized server(s) hosting the app. The individual miners host this application sole by their own profitability consideration. Because of this decentralization mother nature, all TApps include TEA Party:

- Cannot be turn off by any super power. As long as there are a minimal number of miners host this application, it will run forever

- No one, including the host miner can control sensorship of the content. The content is owned and protected by their creator's private key. A miner can choose to stop hosting but cannot selectively choose what content to show or hide.

- There is no free lunch. Every action that cost any computing resources need to get paid by someone. In TEA Party's particular case, every message need to be paid to send, to store, to notify receipiant. 

  

In order to get the features above, the under technical layer is very different from existing cloud computing and blockchain. It is a new tech stack based on later 2020's technologies. 

  

We will go through the cutting edge technologies in TEA Party, and tutor you around and help you make your own TEA Applications (TApp).
