This is usually called a web server in traditional cloud computing. In the TEA Project, since it's fully decentralized, there's no such thing as a web server. Instead, any miner can plant a CML into a mining machine to enable their machine to host TApp backend actors.

This machine is usually called hosting CML, or host. In the past, we've referred to hosting nodes as B CML.
