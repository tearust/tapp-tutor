Staking is a way of earning mining revenue without having to setup a mining machine. Users can buy miner staking tokens to earn a percentage of a mining machine's rewards, either as TEA revenue or TApp token dividend rewards.

The earlier a user buys a staking token, the higher percentage of rewards that's earned. That's because the earlier one buys into a bonding curve, the more chances they have for both price appreciation and a longer duration of dividend rewards from holding the token.

There are two options for users who want to stake to TEA Project mining nodes:

- Staking to hosting CML nodes is where users earn part of an **individual hosting CML miner's** revenue stream. This includes public service rewards as well as rewards from hosting TApps.
- Staking to state machine CML nodes (state machine validators) is where users can earn a share of **all state machine CML mining nodes'** revenue stream.

Both of these options are exercised through buying the associated mining stake token that's issued along a bonding curve.

- For hosting CML, a user would buy an individual miner's staking token.
- For state machine CML, all users buy the same mining staking token that represents all state machine mining validators.

## Calculating state machine validator rewards
Unlike hosting CML mining nodes who also earn TApp tokens from TApp hosting, the state machine validator nodes earn exclusively in TEA tokens. The following sections will provide more details on the block reward schedule for both state machine validator nodes as well as the hosting CML nodes. As you can see below, state machine CML validators earn over 3x as much TEA rewards compared to hosting CML nodes (although hosting CML also earn TApp tokens and sometimes TEA from hosting TApps).

#### Preset mining cap and reward rate		
The initial TEA reward per block starts at 9.06944 and reduces by 30% every half year until the end of the second year (measured from the token generation event). The total number of blocks in a half year is 2,635,200.

#### Public service emmision rate with periodically reduction		

The initial mining rewards per block broken down by type of mining is as follows: 7T (state machine CML) + 2T (hosting CML) + .06944 (layer1 staking).

| Description  | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Initial public service reward per block at Genesis Block**  | 9.06944  |   
| First reward reduction at 1/2 year  |  6.348608 |   
| 2nd reward reduction at 1 year  | 4.4440256  | 
| 3rd reward reduction at 1- 1/2 year  | 3.11081792  | 
| Last reward reduction at 2 year	  | 2.177572544  | 				
				
				
| TEA public service mining reward emissions  | Total during period  |
|---|---|
| TEA reward emmission during 0 ~  1/2 year  | 23899788.29	  |   
| TEA reward emmission during 1/2 ~  1 year  |  16729851.8 |   
| TEA reward emmission during 1~  1-1/2 year | 11710896.26  | 	
| TEA reward emmission during 1-1/2 ~ 2 year  | 8197627.383  | 

## Locking for earning more rewards
After users purchase state machine miner staking tokens, they can lock these tokens to earn extra rewards. The extra rewards are given as a discount in the token purchase price. These discounts are paid out by a pre-mined allocation from the genesis block, so the amount of TEA being dscounted is accounted for in the mining stake token bonding curve.

The discounts given to lockers is as follows:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lock duration** | 3 month |	6 month	| 12 month	| 18 month	|  24 month  |
| **Mining stake token discount** | 2.5% | 5% | 10%	| 15% | 20% |
