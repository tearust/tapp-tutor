No matter what kind of blockchain or distributed system, the most important thing that a consensus is trying to solve is get a sequence of transactions (or events) that all nodes agree on.

There are many consensus are used, such as PoW (Proof of Work), PoS (Proof of Stake). All of them are slow and costy. 

In TEA Project, we use physical value of time from GPS satellites as the source of timestamp. All events attach a TPM protected timestamp when sending to different distributed replicas. All replicas can get the same order regardless the geolocation and network latency.
