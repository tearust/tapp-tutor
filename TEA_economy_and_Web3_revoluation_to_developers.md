This article is probably the only non-technical document in our developer-oriented documents. But I still want it to be here because it is totally focus to you, our developers. I would like to show you what the TEA economy and Web3 revolution means to you as a developer. What changes you will experence in the following 5-30 years.

# To work or not to work, this is the question
I live in the Silicon Valley. A place full of tech giants and startups, well, also homeless and drug addictions.  This is not the biggest conflliction for most developers. The biggest confliction is should I work (for a company) or make a decent life on my ambitials open source project? 

On one side, work as a software engineer in tech giant is well paid, higher than most lawyers and doctors. The salary is a must-have to live in Silicon Valley, if you are not a homeless. On the other side, you probably have a dream to build some real cool open source projects but... hopefully earn some donation? Hey, sounds like asking "spare changes?" on the street?

Let's see how Web3 and TEA project can merge the two sides of a coin.

# API-as-a-Service, you do not need to make a full application
Write good code and run a successful start / business are two different stories.
Running a successful business requires much more skillsets than a regular developers have. Business sense, marketing, speech etc. Simply write a wonder code cannot make profit at the current Web 2.0 world. That's why most of talent developers still have to get hired by those tech giants to make a living. But what if simple write an API and it can bring profit to you? Yes, just an API, you do not need a UI front end, no business development, no backend server mentainance, still make money? Is it possible?

In Web2.0 no, In Web3.0, in TEA project, yes!

This is called API-as-a-Service. Back in the year 2020, we made a early stage demo of TEA Project. In that demo, we described a use case that Bob wrote a Tensorflow AI code and make profit without dealling with anything else. Bob does not need to host his code, he doesn't need to find customer to load their data to run against his code. He simple upload his code to TEA Project, and someone will pay. He doesn't need to worry about someone else steal his code because his code **doesn't** have to be open sourced.

# Micro payment and high scalability are the keys
TEA has an open tokenomics that no free lunch at all. Anything in TEA needs someone to pay. No one work for free! Miners will get paid by every single code use their CPU/GPU/TPU, occupied RAM/ Hard disk, transfer using their network. Developer get paid by every time his code is executed. Consumer need to pay for whatever service they received. Those micro payment can be done at ultra low cost. That is fully benefit from TEA layer2 solution. Compare with ETH, it is **almost** free, and fast.

# Trust and security protect your profit
You do not have to open source. Your code can be close-sourced if you do not need to get audit for security reasons. You only need to send your code to the TEA Project trusted enclave. Your code will be compiled there and run inside in enclave. No one can steal your code. The execution environment can also be trusted, so any miner can host your code and run, no need to send your code to your clients to run , or you maintain a server on your own. All these business are handled by the TEA Project. Your profit is protected and guaranteed.

# Web 3 applications are composed by all these smaller API-as-a-Service modules
In Web2, you will have to open source your code as a library, so that other developers can use it **for free or donation** in their own project. The open source contributors only earn much less than they supposed to get. In TEA Project, all these components are just API functions, running inside one or more mining machines. Application does not **include** those code in its own binary, but directly **call** those APIs and pay for the usage by the TEA Project state machine. The developer of those code get paid in TEA token from the state machine periodically. 

# Pay by use is the new business model
Just like today's internet are all links to different webpages hosted in different servers. The web3 applications would be too. The full application can be composed by thousands of those smaller compoents that writen by different developers. They are all **linked** instead of **included(as open source library)**.  Pay by use is the new business model. 

This model encourage developers to be free of being hired. They can make a decent living without the hussle of running a **full** businese. Simple write good code, join the TEA Projecdt, and get paid. Enjoy your life and happy coding!
