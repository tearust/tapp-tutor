Txns are also called [[commands]], or events. 

A txn is generated by a [[back_end_actor]] or [[blockchain_listener]] and executed in a [[state_machine_actor]] to update the [[state]].

Txn is the only outside traigger to change the [[state]]. In other words, all state change is trigged by txn(s).

# Some examples of txns
Alice send 10T to Bob. This is a transfer txn.
Every 1000 blocks, we run a clean up of the blockchain storage, this is a [[blockchain_listener]] triggered txn. It likes a cron job.
If the blockchain notice a new TApp is created, do the generate tapp account task. This is also a [[blockchain_listener]] triggered txn, but it is not a cron job.

# Atomic successful or failed on execution
A txn can be successfully executed or failed. If it is successful, it may or may not change the state. but if it is failed, it will definitely **NOT** change the state. 

There is **no partial** successful. It either fully successful or totally failed.
