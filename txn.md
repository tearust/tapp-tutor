Txns are also called [[commands]], or events. 

A txn is generated by a [[back_end_actor]] or [[blockchain_listener]] and executed in a [[state_machine_actor]] to update the [[state]].

A txn is the only outside trigger that's able to change the [[state]]. In other words, all state changes are triggered by txn(s).

# Some examples of txns
Alice sends 10T to Bob. This is a transfer txn.
Every 1000 blocks, we run a clean up of the blockchain storage. This is a [[blockchain_listener]] triggered txn. It looks like a cron job.
If the blockchain notices a new TApp is created, then it performs a **generate tapp account** task. Although this is also a [[blockchain_listener]] triggered txn, it's not considered to be like a cron job.

# Binary successful or failed on execution
A txn can be successfully executed or failed. If it's successful, it may or may not change the state. But if it's failed, it will definitely **NOT** change the state. 

There are **no partially successful txns**. They're either fully successful or totally failed.
