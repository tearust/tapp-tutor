Query is a "read-only" inquiry to read a state value from the state machine.

Because TEA state machine nodes are consistent with each other, the hosting node can access any other state machine node to query inforamtion.

There's no wait time associated with queries. The state machine can always check its current state and respond back to the hosting node.
