Unlike other blockchain chain projects that waste a lot of computing power in consensus competition, TEA project uses all computing power in useful tasks. Majorify of them are commercial tasks from client's application, which of course paid by the clients. Minority of them are public validation or DAO governance. These small part of tasks cannot get paid by any specific client, they would have to be paid by the DAO. They are all public services.

Public services are including:
- Remote attestation (thinking of jury duty in real life)
- State machine maintainance (thinking of goverment expense)
- DAO governance (thinking of election/voting in real life)
- Other tasks that are necessary and benefit the public

The DAO will pay these public services from TEA token inflation. There are fixed number of TEA token (this number may change over the time but predictable) are minted in every block, and are paid to the miners who executed public services in this block.

Those inflation will be hedged by the TEA burning caused by [[CML_auction]].
