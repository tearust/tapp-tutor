OrbitDb (https://orbitdb.org/) is a Peer-to-Peer Database for the Decentralized Web
> [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. OrbitDB uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as its data storage and [IPFS Pubsub](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/core/commands/pubsub.go#L23) to automatically sync databases with peers. Itâ€™s an eventually consistent database that uses [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) for conflict-free database merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for decentralized apps (dApps), blockchain applications, and offline-first web applications.

In the TEA Project, every [[hosting_CML]] has an OrbitDb instance running **outside** of the enclave. 

OrbitDb is used to store large data blobs. OrbitDb provides limited non-relational database features but at a much lower cost. For a relational database, developers can use [[GlueSQL]]. For more essential account balance (money) data, we'd suggest using [[state]] instead.

See [[get_started#Storage| the storage section]] for a more detailed comparison.

# Privacy protection
IPFS is open to the public. Anything stored in the IPFS can be accessed by anyone. OrbitDB is no exception. How do we protect the data in the OrbitDB? We use the [[App_AES_Key]] 

The data used in one applicaiton is encrypted using this application AES key inside enclave. When the data is saved to the OrbitDB, it has been encrypted. It will be decrypted when again loaded into the enclave by the same application. Other application cnanot decrypt because they do not have such [[App_AES_Key]].

The [[App_AES_Key]] is stored inside the [[State_Machine]] which is consider the top security of the whole TEA Project network. When a new applicaiton host instance starts, it will request such a AES key to the [[State_Machine]]. After a restricted scurity check, the instance can receive such AES key. Because the AES key only live inside enclave (both state machine or hosting nodes.), it is unknown to outside world.

# Sync
For every TApp, there are multiple hosting nodes. Every node has their own OrbitDB instance running inside the node (outside of [[enclave]]). They sync with each other using the standard OrbitDb sync algorithm. Please read https://orbitdb.org for more detial on sync.  

Because all of these instances share the same [[App_AES_Key]], the data would be the same across all nodes. They can take the advantage of duplication of IPFS/OrbitDB.

# Cost
Since OrbitDB lives outside of [[enclave]] and stored on hard disk(actually IPFS). It would be much cheaper than the [[State_Machine]], as the [[State_Machine]] data stays inside the RAM of [[encoave]]. Of course, the [[State_Machine]] would be a much limited resource and much more expensive than hard disk outside of enclave.

# Eventual consistency
OrbitDB provides [**eventual consistency**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency).  Which means you could get temporary inconsistency across all nodes. Your TApp has to handle this sceanario in the business and UI logic.

If your data is very time sensitive that requires [**strong consistency**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_consistency), please use more expensive [[State_Machine]] instead.
