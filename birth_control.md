# The ecological balance
The ecological balance between computing market supply and demand are CMLs and TApps. Supply is the CMLs that can execute computing tasks. Demand is the TApps that consume the computing services. 

The DAO monitors the usages (idle time and waiting time) of every CMLs. If majority CMLs are waiting, it means supply is over demand. If majority CMLs are busy but the TApps has tasks waiting in line to be executed, it means demand is over supply.

Based on the demand supply ratio, DAO will automatically increase or reduce the new CML seeds supply to the [[Marketplace]]. 

Another indicator is the price of the CML auction. If the auction price is too high, DAO should increase the CML seeds supply. Otherwise, reduce.

This adjustment is made by the DAO governance. The major factors can be changed by DAO voting. During the first two years of the TEA Project operation, the DAO is not mature enough or the community is not big enough for voting, the project team will control the birth rate. After 2 years, the DAO will take over the control.
